<li>The process of finding the occurance of a particular data item in a
list is known as searching.</li>

<li>If the search element is present in the collected elements or array
then the search process is said to be successful. The search is said to be unsuccessful if the given element does not exist in the
array.</li>

<li>Linear search is a search algorithm that tries to find a certain value
in a set of data. It operates by checking every element of a list (or
array) one at a time in sequence until a match is found.</li>

<li>The linear search was seen to be easy to implement and relatively
efficient to use for small lists. But very time consuming for long
unsorted lists.</li>

<li>Binary search only works on sorted lists (or arrays). It finds the middle
element, makes a comparison to determine whether the desired
value comes before or after it and then searches the remaining half
in the same manner.</li>

<li>The binary search is an improvement, in that it eliminates half the
list from consideration at each iteration. The prerequisite for it is that
the list should be sorted order.</li></ul>
