<li>An algorithm is a sequence of computational steps that start with a
set of input(s) and finish with valid output(s)</li>

<li>An algorithm is correct if for every input(s), it halts with correct
output(s).</li>

<li>Computational complexity of algorithms are generally referred to by
space complexity and time complexity of the program</li>

<li>The Space complexity of an algorithm is the amount of main memory
is needed to run the program till completion.</li>

<li>The Time complexity of an algorithm is the amount of computer time
it needs to run the program till completion.</li>

<li>O(1) &lt; O(log(n)) &lt; O(n) &lt; O(n log(n)) &lt; O(n 2 ) &lt; O(n 3 ) ... &lt;O(2 n ).</li></ul>
