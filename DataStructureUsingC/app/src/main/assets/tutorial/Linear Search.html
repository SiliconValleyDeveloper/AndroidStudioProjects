<h1>Linear Search</h1>
<p>Linear search, also called as sequential search, is a very simple method used for searching an array
for a particular value. It works by comparing the value to be searched with every element of the
array one by one in a sequence until a match is found. Linear search is mostly used to search an
unordered list of elements (array in which data elements are not sorted).</p>

<h2>Algorithm</h2>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Linear Search ( Array A, Value x)

Step 1: Set i to 1
Step 2: if i &gt; n then go to step 7
Step 3: if A[i] = x then go to step 6
Step 4: Set i to i + 1
Step 5: Go to Step 2
Step 6: Print Element x Found at index i and go to step 8
Step 7: Print element not found
Step 8: Exit
