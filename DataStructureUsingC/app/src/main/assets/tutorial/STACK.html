<li>In Computer Science, stack is one of the most essential linear data
structures and an abstract data type.</li>

<li>The insertion of element onto a stack is called Push and deletion
operation is called pop.</li>

<li>The most and least reachable elements in a stack are respectively
known as the top and bottom.</li>

<li>The insertion and deletion operations are carried out at one end.
Hence, the recent element inserted is deleted first. If we want to
delete a particular element of a stack, it is necessary to delete all the
elements appearing before the element. This means that the last
item to be added to a stack is the first item to be removed. Accordingly,
stack is a set of elements in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) technique.</li>
<li>When stack has no element, it is called empty stack.</li>
<li>Overflow occurs when the stack is full and there is no space for a
new element, and an attempt is made to push a new element.</li>

<li>Underflow occurs when the stack is empty, and an attempt is made
to pop an element.</li>

<li>Static implementation can be implemented using arrays. However,
it is a very simple method but it has few limitations.</li>

<li>Pointer can also be used for implementation of stack. Linked list
implementation is an example of this type of dynamic implementation.
The limitations noticed in static implementation can be removed by
using dynamic implementation.</li> </ul>
