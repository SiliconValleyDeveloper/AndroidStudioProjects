<li><p>The data is a fact about people, places or some entities. In computers,
data is simply the value assigned to a variable.</p></li>
<li><p>Information is a group of related data conveying some meaning.</p></li>
<li><p>Data structures are of two types : linera data structure and non linear
data structure. For example Array, Linked list, Queue etc. are linear
datastructure and Trees and Graphs etc are non-linear data structure.</p></li>

<li><p>The possible data structure operations are - traversing, searching,
inserting, deleting, sorting and merging.</p></li>

<li><p>An array is a collection of two or more adjacent memory locations
containing same types of data.</p></li>

<li><p>A pointer is a memory variable that stores a memory address of
another variable. It can have any name that is valid for other variable
and it is declared in the same way as any other variable. It is always
denoted by ‘*’.</p></li>

<li><p>A structure is a collection of variables under a single name. These
variables can be of different types, and each has a name which is
used to select it from the structure.</p></li>

<li><p>A strcture which contains a member field that point to the same
structure type are called a self-referential structure.</p></li>

<li><p>There is a technique in C language, in which a program can specify
an array size at run time. The process of allocating memory at run
time is known as dynamic memory allocation. There are three
dynamic momory allocation functions : malloc( ), calloc( ), realloc( )
and one memory deallocation function which is free( ).</p></li>

<li><p>An abstract data type is a formal specification of the logical properties
of a data type such as its values, operations that are to be defined
for the data type etc.</p></li>
