<li>A graph is a structure that is often used to model the arbitrary
relationships among the data objects while solving many problems.</li>

<li>A graph is a structure made of two components: a set of vertices V,
and the set of edges E. Therefore, a graph is G = (V,E), where G is
a graph.</li>

<li>The graph may be directed or undirected. When the graph is directed,
every edge of the graph is an ordered pair of vertices connected by
the edge.</li>

<li>When the graph is undirected, every edge of the graph is an
unordered pair of vertices connected by the edge.</li>

<li>Adjacency matrices and adjacency lists are used to represent
graphs.</li>

<li>A graph can be traversed by using either the depth first traversal or
the breadth first traversal.</li>

<li>When a graph is traversed by visiting in the forward (deeper) direction
as long as possible, the traversal is called depth first traversal.</li>

<li>When a graph is traversed by visiting all the adjacencies of a node/
vertex first, the traversal is called breadth first traversal.</li></ul>
