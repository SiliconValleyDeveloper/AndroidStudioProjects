<h1>Circular Linked List</h1>
<p>Circular Linked List is a variation of Linked list in which first element points to last element and last element points to first element. Both Singly Linked List and Doubly Linked List can be made into as circular linked list.</p>
<h2>Singly Linked List as Circular</h2>
<p>In singly linked list, the next pointer of the last node points to the first node.</p>

<h2>Doubly Linked List as Circular</h2>
<p>In doubly linked list, the next pointer of the last node points to the first node and the previous pointer of the first node points to the last node making the circular in both directions.</p>

<p>As per above shown illustrations, following are the important points to be considered.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Last Link's next points to first link of the list in both cases of singly as well as doubly linked list.</p></li>
<li><p>First Link's prev points to the last of the list in case of doubly linked list.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Basic Operations</h2>
<p>Following are the important operations supported by a circular list.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>insert</b> &minus; insert an element in the start of the list.</p></li>
<li><p><b>delete</b> &minus; insert an element from the start of the list.</p></li>
<li><p><b>display</b> &minus; display the list.</p></li>
</ul>
