<li>Trees are used to organize a collection of data items into a
hierarchical structure.</li>

<li>A tree is a collection of elements called nodes, one of which is
distinguished as the root, along with a relation that places a
hierarchical structure on the node.</li>

<li>The degree of a node of a tree is the number of descendants that
node has.</li>
<li>A leaf node of a tree is a node with a degree equal to 0.
<li>The level of the root node is 0, and as we descend the tree, we
increment the level of each node by 1.</li>

<li>Depth of a tree is the maximum value of the level for the nodes in the
tree.</li>
<li>The maximum number of nodes at level i in a binary tree is 2 i .</li>
<li>Inorder, preorder, and postorder are the three commonly used
traversals that are used to traverse a binary tree.</li>

<li>In inorder traversal, we start with the root node, visit the left subtree
first, then process the data of the root node, followed by that of the
right subtree.</li>
<li>In preorder traversal, we start with the root node. First we process
the data of the root node, then visit the left subtree, then the right
subtree.</li>
<li>In postorder traversal, we start with the root node, visit the left subtree
first, then visit the right subtree, and then process the data of the
root node.</li> </ul>
