<li>Sorting is a method of arranging data in ascending or descending
order.</li>

<li>The Insertion Sort is so named because on each iteration of its main
loop it inserts the next element in its correct position relative to the
subarray that has already been processed. The complexity of
Insertion Sort is O(n 2 ).</li>

<li>In Selection Sort, the first element is compared with remaining
(nâ€“1) elements and the smallest element is placed at the first location.
Again the second element is compared with the remaining (n -2)
elements and pick out the smallest element from the list and placed
in the second location and so on until the largest element of the list.</li>
<li>The complexity of Selection Sort is O(n 2 ).</li>

<li>The Bubble Sort is probably the simplest of the sorting algorithms.</li>
<li>Its name comes from the idea that the larger elements &#34bubble up&#34 to
the top (the high end) of the array like the bubbles in waters.The
complexity of Bubble Sort is O(n 2 ).</li>

<li>The Quick Sort works by partitioning the array into two pieces
separated by a single element that is greater than all the elements in
the left piece and smaller than all the elements in the right piece.</li>
<li>The guarantees that the single element, called the pivot element, is in its correct polsition. Then the algorithm proceeds, applying the
same method to the two pieces separately. This is naturally recursive,
and very quick. Time consumption of the quick sort depends on the
location of the pivot element inthe list. The complexity of Quick Sort
is O(nlogn).</li></ul>
