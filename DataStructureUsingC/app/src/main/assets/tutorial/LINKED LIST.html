<ul>
<li>Linked list is a linear dynamic data structure. It is a collection of
some nodes containing homogeneous elements. Each node consists
of a data part and one or more address part depending upon the
types of the linked list.</li>

<li>In case of linked list, the amount of data will be stored is not fixed at
compile time like array. Here data can be stored and removed
dynamically at run time.</li>

<li>In case of linked list, data need not to be stored in contiguous memory
locations like array. So direct access of any node is not possible.</li>

<li>There three different types of linked list available which are singly
linked list, doubly linked list and circular linked list.</li>

<li>A node of singly linked list has two fields, one field contains information
and other field contain address of the next node. The address field
of the last node contain NULL.</li>

<li>The structure of a node of circular linked list is same with singly
linked list. The address field of the last node of a circular linked list
contains the address of the first node.</li>

<li>A node of doubly linked list has three fields, one field contain
information, one field contain the address of the next node and the
third field contains the address of the previous node.</li></ul></html>
